## Management inventory system

A Python capstone project supervised by ~ Melody Bonareri

### Problem Statement
Bookstores manage a wide variety of titles with varying demand, publication cycles, and suppliers. Many small and medium-sized bookstores rely on manual record-keeping or basic spreadsheets to track book inventory and sales. These methods make it difficult to accurately monitor stock levels, identify fast-selling and slow-moving titles, and determine when and how much to reorder from suppliers.

As a result, bookstores often experience stock-outs of popular books, excess inventory of low-demand titles, and inefficient restocking decisions. There is a need for an automated inventory management system that can track books, manage stock levels, record sales, and analyze sales trends. Such a system would help bookstore owners maintain optimal inventory levels, reduce losses, and make informed, data-driven restocking decisions.

### Project Description
The system helps a small store track products, manage sales, prevent running out of stock, and understand what sells best.

Inventory management system for a small store. It will:
1.	Tracks products, stock levels, and suppliers
2.	It will notify the business when restock is needed (low stock alert)
3.	Recommends what to restock based on sales
4.	Best and worst performing products
5.	low-stock alerts and restocking recommendations

### Core Feature
#### 1. Product Management:
   
- Each product will be tracked
- This lets the store know what exists and how much is left.


#### 2. Inventory Reports:

Quick inventroy insights, not guesswork.
Basic reports like:
- Current inventory list
- Low-stock products
- Total inventory value
- Best-selling products


#### 3. Sales Tracking:

What sells the most? What sells the least?


#### 4. Stock Operations

The system should be able to:
- Add new products
- Update product details
- Increase stock (restocking)
- Decrease stock (sales)
👉 This keeps inventory accurate after every sale.

#### 5. Low-Stock Alerts

When stock goes below a set level:
- Warn the store owner
- Suggest restocking
👉 Prevents the “Oops, we’re out of stock” moment.



### Technology Used
- Python (OOP)
- SQLite
- CSV
- BeautifulSoup + requests


### Optional (Nice-to-Have)

- Barcode scanning
- Export reports to CSV
- Simple GUI 
- Sales charts 


### What Makes It a good inventory system.

A good system is:
✅ Easy to understand
✅ Hard to break
✅ Easy to extend
✅ Matches real store needs
