## Management inventory system

A Python capstone project supervised by ~ Melody Bonareri

### Project Description
The system helps a small store track products, manage sales, prevent running out of stock, and understand what sells best.

Inventory management system for a small store. It will:
1.	Tracks products, stock levels, and suppliers
2.	It will notify the business when restock is needed (low stock alert)
3.	Recommends what to restock based on sales
4.	Best and worst performing products
5.	low-stock alerts, basic sales analysis, and restocking recommendations

### Core Feature
#### 1. Product Management:
   
- Each product should be tracked
- This lets the store know what exists and how much is left.


#### 2. Inventory Reports:

Quick inventroy insights, not guesswork.
Basic reports like:
- Current inventory list
- Low-stock products
- Total inventory value
- Best-selling products


#### 3. Sales Tracking:

What sells the most? What sells the least?


#### 4. Stock Operations

Your system should be able to:
- Add new products
- Update product details
- Increase stock (restocking)
- Decrease stock (sales)
👉 This keeps inventory accurate after every sale.

#### 5. Low-Stock Alerts

When stock goes below a set level:
- Warn the store owner
- Suggest restocking
👉 Prevents the “Oops, we’re out of stock” moment.



### Technology Used

### What Makes It a good inventory system.

A good system is:
✅ Easy to understand
